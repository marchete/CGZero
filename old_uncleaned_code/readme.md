This is the code I used to get the 6th place bot. I've changed a lot of parameters and code while training the bot, so I can't be sure what was the good hyperparameters for reaching top10.
Trained bots should be similar in strength. Cleaned code has added diversity on first turns, it should be less blind to some moves.
